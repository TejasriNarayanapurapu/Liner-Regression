Linear Regression: Student Marks Prediction
Implemented a linear regression model to predict student exam scores based on study hours using the student.csv dataset.

Loaded and visualized the dataset (study hours vs marks)

Applied simple linear regression using scikit-learn

Evaluated model using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Plotted regression line to show prediction trend

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Outcome: Accurately predicted student marks and demonstrated a clear positive correlation between study time and performance.
